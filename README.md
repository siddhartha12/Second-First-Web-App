# RehashWebDev
Did my first project website for CS50 a few years ago. All of that knowledge is still somewhere in the back of my brain. Attempting to relearn it by pursuing a small flask project I searched and found on YouTube. Diving back into web development with this small project. Hopefully can sustainably do coding now this time more seriously than I did previously.

Also trying to start building a more public and more active GitHub profile. Maybe not the best time to learn coding cuz AI. Just hoping to work on some skills and enjoy the journey.
